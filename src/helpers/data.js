            <h2>Fish Farming in Ghana</h2>
            <p>
                Fish farming is one of the most popular agribusinesses in Ghana with a huge profit margin.In Ghana, fish constitutes about 60 per cent of animal protein in the diets.Fish availability in Ghana consists of 47 per cent harvested fish, 18 per cent imports, 3 per cent farmed fish and 32 per cent deficit.
                Due to this high deficit of over half a million metric tonnes of fish and fishery products, and high demand for fish, the Government has started encouraging local fish farming to increase fish production.
                <br /> <br />
                As an entrepreneur, this presents an opportunity to cash out on this fish farming project in the country.
                How to Start Fish Farming Business in Ghana
                In this guide, you’ll learn all that it takes to start a lucrative fish farming business in Ghana.Even though you had no prior knowledge about fish farming, this article is for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 1 – Choose Your Fish Species</b>
                <br />
                There are different species of fish in Ghana.You can choose to breed any or even all of them at the same time.However, it is recommended you start with a single specie if you’re a beginner.
                1. Tilapia
                Tilapias account for at least 95 % of farmed fish in Ghana.This specie of fish lives in fresh shallow water.It produces very rapidly and grows fast, also, it easy to cultivates and is very popular in the Ghanaian market.The world aquaculture production of Tilapia Fish farming is 4.2million tonnes with an estimated value of about 3 to $ 3.5billion.

                2. Catfish
                Catfish is the second most cultivated fish species in Ghana.One thing good about catfish is that it is one of the easiest fish species to cultivate.So, people naturally flow to the direction of fish specie they found to be the easiest to cultivate.

                <b>Step 2 – Secure A Good Location</b>
                <br />
                You will need a good location to start your fish farming business.It is recommended you get a piece of land in a place where it doesn’t cause any environmental disturbance.if you’re going into a small scale fish farming business, then a small space will be enough.
                However, if you’re going into large scale fish farming business, you’ll need a bigger space for your farm.The bigger the size of your farm, the bigger your land.

            <p>
                <b>Step 3 – Choose a Fish Culture System</b>
                <br />
                Depending on your location, you will need to choose a fish culture system.A fish culture system consists of a combination of inputs: water, physical installations, feeds, labour and fish.
                Each such combination yields a certain output in the form of fish(or other aquatic animals).The appropriate combinations are those for which the value of the inputs used during a specified period is less than the value the producer obtains for the fish produced.

                1. Cages
                A cage or net pen is a system that confines the fish in a mesh enclosure.By strict definition, a cage and a net pen differ based on their construction.A cage has a completely rigid frame(on all sides) and a net pen has a rigid frame only around the top.

                2. Raceways
                Raceway systems are among the earliest methods used for inland aquaculture.A raceway usually consists of rectangular basins or canals constructed of concrete and equipped with an inlet and outlet.

                3. Ponds
                A fish pond is a controlled pond, artificial lake, or reservoir that is stocked with fish and is used in aquaculture for fish farming.

                <i>Your choice of culture system depends on the cost of feed is a large proportion(50 % or more) of the cost per kg of fish produced.Also, in Ghana, the cost of feed will be the determining factor. However, in this article, we will recommend the use of a fish pond for fish farming. </i>

            <p>
                <b>Step 4 – Construct a Fish Pond</b>
                <br />
                In constructing a fish pond, you should consider the size, construction method, water supply, drainage and maintenance.The size of the pond will depend solely on the land size and water availability.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 5 – Provide a Source of Water Supply</b>
                <br />
                You also need a constant source of water supply for your farm.A typical pond will be fed by water from a borehole or a nearby water body.The supply channel should be constructed so that it is possible to regulate, including completely blocking the inflow of water to the pond.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 6 – Provide a Drainage System</b>
                <br />
                You can’t start a fish farming business without a proper drainage system.There are three alternatives for drainage: (i) a monk, (ii) turn - down drain pipes, or, (iii) siphoning in combination with an overflow(in case the inflow can not be fully controlled).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 7 – Supply Fingerlings</b>
                <br />
                For your farm to become fully functional, you’ll need to supply fingerlings of your pferred species of fish.You can get fingerlings from a nearby fish pond for your farm.Also, you need to take your time to identify fast - growing and disease - resistant breeds of fingerlings to ensure profitability.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 8 – Get Quality Feeds</b>
                <br />
                For your fish to grow healthy and faster you’ll need to provide your fingerlings with a quality feed.There are two ways to obtain feed for fish farming in Ghana: locally produced feed and imported feed.
                However, fish feeds locally produced are in bad quality as most of them are not extruded.Imported feed is appropriately 30 % more expensive than locally produced.So importation is not a quick fix.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Step 9 – Start Marketing</b>
                <br />
                Marketing is an integral part of a successful fish farming business.Harvested fishes are sold based on weight measured in kg.You need to know the right pricing for your fish.Ghana has an already established market for fish farming, so you shouldn’t have difficulties selling off all your products.

            <b>CHICKENS</b>
            <p>Raising chicks is exciting! Knowing how is just as important. Here’s our beginner’s guide to raising chickens. This is the first article in a 6-part introduction so that we can help you “start from scratch,” so to speak.</p>
            <h4><i>Why Should You Raise Chickens?</i></h4>
            <p>There’s a lot to like about raising chickens in your backyard. The eggs are a real temptation—tastier and fresher than any store-bought eggs, and better for baking, too. The shells, along with the chicken poop, can be tossed right into the compost pile. Much of the day, the birds entertain themselves, picking at grass, worms, beetles, and all of the good things that go into making those yummy farm eggs. Plus, with their keen eye for insect pests, chickens make for great gardening companions.</p>
            <p>Things to Consider Before Getting Chickens</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, check local town ordinances to ensure that keeping chickens is even allowed in your neighborhood or if there is a limit to the number of chickens you can keep at once. The last thing you want is to invest time and money into preparing for chickens and then find out that you can’t even keep them!</li>
                <li>Make sure you have the space for a henhouse or a full-size chicken coop. It has to hold a feeder and water containers, a roosting area, and a nest box for every three hens. A proper coop should be large enough that you can stand in it to gather eggs and shovel manure comfortably, but a simple henhouse can be quite a bit smaller. Plus, any housing must be sturdy enough to keep your chickens safe from all the predators out there! Here’s how to build a chicken coop in your backyard.</li>
                <li>Chickens need food (and water) daily. Feed is about $20 per 50-pound bag at my co-op, but prices vary depending on your location and the quality of the feed. How long a bag lasts depends on the number of chickens that you have.</li>
                <li>Hens will lay eggs through spring and summer and into the fall, as long as they have 12 to 14 hours of daylight. Expect to collect eggs daily, or even twice a day.</li>
                <li>All year ‘round, you’ll have to shovel manure.Yippee!</li >
                <li>If you go away on vacation, you’ll need a reliable chicken - sitter—and they can be scarcer than hens’ teeth!</li >
            </ul>
            <h4>How to Raise Chickens: (Flock Size, Spacing, and Start-Up Cost)</h4>

            <b>How Many Chickens Should I Keep?</b>
            <ol>
                <li>Chickens are sociable creatures, so plan to keep three to six birds. With this amount, you’ll always have a steady supply of eggs, since an adult hen lays about two eggs every three days, on average.</li>
                <li>Chickens are most productive in the first two years of their lives; after that, egg production will slow, so you’ll need to think about replacing your flock with younger birds eventually. Young chicks can be bought from suppliers quite easily, or you can hatch your own if you have a rooster (which we do NOT recommend). Read more about raising baby chicks here!</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>

            <b>How Much Space Do Chickens Need?</b>

            Ultimately, it depends on which breed of chicken you’re raising. According to the University of Missouri Extension, one medium-sized chicken needs at least 3 square feet of floor space inside the coop and 8-10 square feet outdoors. The more space, the happier and healthier the chickens will be; overcrowding contributes to disease and feather picking.

            The birds will need a place to spread their wings, so to speak: a sizeable chicken run, for example, or a whole backyard. (Our hens have lots of outdoor time. They have places to take a dust bath and catch a few rays.) Either way, the space must be fenced in order to keep the chickens in and predators out. (Predators include your own Fido and Fluffy, too!) Add chicken-wire fencing to your list of equipment.
            How Much Does Keeping Chickens Cost?
            All of this costs money, of course. The materials to build and furnish a coop and a 20x5-foot run—including wood, fencing, and hardware—are going to set you back at least $300. If you can’t do this work yourself, you’ll also be buying skilled labor.
            Overall, expect to spend between $500 and $700 when just getting started, depending on the size of your flock, coop, and run.
            Gardening with Chickens. <br /> <br />
            Most folks who keep chickens do so largely for the constant supply of fresh eggs, but did you know that keeping chickens can be also be beneficial for the garden?
            When the gardening season has finished for the year, let the chickens into your gardening space and watch them go crazy! They’ll uproot the stems and stalks of weeds and gobble up any damaged or overripe vegetables that remain. They’ll eat any weed seeds or insects they find in the soil, and will peck apart and digest vegetable remnants, especially broccoli stems, carrot tops, chard, and kale. After that, they’ll scratch the ground and peck out hidden worms or insects, mixing up the soil in the process—all with endless enthusiasm and curiosity.
            Chickens don’t only provide a constant supply of fresh eggs—they produce an endless amount of manure, too. Luckily, chicken poo can be composted, aged, and eventually added to the garden. In about 6 months’ time, you will accumulate about 1 cubic foot of manure per chicken.
            During your daily cleaning of the coop, collect and pile up the chicken poop and used bedding materials. The best decomposition occurs when the pile is 2 parts poop to 1 part bedding materials. Lawn clippings and fruit and vegetable kitchen scraps, as well as leaves, twigs, and shredded paper, can also be added into the mix. Soak the pile and, over the next year or so, wet and stir it regularly to add air. A temperature of 130°F to 150°F is recommended to eliminate bacteria.
